# Amstrad CPC Roms

The rom images required to run CPvC are not included in the repository just in case of any potential copyright issues.

These images should be manually downloaded and placed in this folder prior to building CPvC. See http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/ROM_List for download links.

The following rom images should be downloaded and named as below:

|Rom|filename|
|---|---|
|CPC 6128 Lower rom|os6128.rom|
|CPC 6128 BASIC 1.1|basic6128.rom|
|CPC 6128 AMSDOS|amsdos6128.rom|
